    "\n",
    "These two statements are important to have a good foundation in the fundamentals of data science and modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first statement \"All models are wrong, but some are useful\" reflects the idea that no matter how \"complicated\" or sophisticated a model is, it will never exactly replicate real life. This is because a model by nature makes simplifications and approximations in order to help achieve any kind of a solution. This is why the first part of the phrase is important as it emphasizes the fact that no matter how much detail put into creating a model it can never be truly accurate and it should never be considered as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the second part of the statement recognises that despite the flaws of models in replicating the real world exactly, they are useful and valuable if it can capture enough key features of a system to extract approximate data or allow us to observe patterns of behaviour. How useful a model is will depend on the accuracy required in the predictions made or how well of an understanding it provides in how different variables will behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is important because it cautions against being overly confident in a model as it will never reflect the true complexities of life but at the same time appreciate how valuable the extracted data can be when working with models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second statement \"A model may get the right answer for the wrong reason\" reflects the fact that a model can give accurate/correct predictions but the reason they do so might not be routed in correct logic.A model might for example give accurate outcomes for a certain set of variables based on a pattern that does not actually exist or represent the principles of the system being modelled. If this model is then used to provide an outcome for variables outside of the scope of the intial pattern it will usually fail. This is called overfitting which is just one of the possible ways a model might make correct predictions for a certain set of consitions but not others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is important as it emphasises the need to understand and validate why a model works rather than accept that it works based on a limited range of conditions. This principle is fundamental in ensuring a model is reliable."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### B)\n",
    "In order to mitigate the risks and issues implied from the two statementsa several steps can be taken. Before beginning to understand a model it is important that the domain is understood well. This involves understanding the data, process and the assumptions used to simplify and represent the system. For example if modelling fluid flow it is helpful to understand boundary conditions, the type of flow and various other properties and their implications on the model. With a thorough understanding of the domain, such as fluid dynamics, the right equations can be chosen (Navier-Stokes, Euler, potential flow, etc.) and numerical methods (finite difference, finite element, boundary element, etc.) that best represent the system that is being modelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not always feasible, structuring a model on well established theories and using emprical evidence that outlines the way the system works well. Using a theoretical framework helps ensure that the model closely reflects the mechanisms and interactions in real life. Empirical evidence ensures that a model is validated using real world data making sure it is practically applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that can be caused from a lack of true consideration of the statements is overfitting. Using only one specific data set makes the model susceptible to working due the noise and not the underlying logic. A diverse dataset helps the model to distinguish between the underlying signal (true pattern) and noise (random or irrelevant patterns). Therefore it is very important that a variety of data sources are utiised in order to reduce the possibility of overfitting. Overfitting can lead to models that work well with some specific data but outside of this begins to fail. So techniques such as regularisation or simplifiying the model can also help reduce this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of these are considered it is very important to rigorously validate and test the models output against analytical and unseen data. A sensitivity analysis is also vital to help idenitfy which variables or assumptions affect the output of the model and how significant this impact is. This validationa and analysis ensures that the model is robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the construction of mathematical models, ensuring that they are understandable is just as critical as their precision and stability. A model that can be easily interpreted engenders trust by making its inner workings clear, which also simplifies the process of refining and troubleshooting. Furthermore, it's important for the model to undergo regular reviews and updates, which keeps it relevant and accurate as new data comes to light and circumstances evolve. Ethical considerations cannot be overlooked either; it's imperative to examine models for biases that could negatively affect outcomes and therefore the users of the model. Integrating ethical considerations into the modeling process is a safeguard against the inadvertent reinforcement of existing biases, preventing unjust or detrimental outcomes. These three aspects—clarity, adaptability, and ethical responsibility are essential practices for the application of mathematical models (not just mathematical) to real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst all of the above can reduce the issues it is important to once again acknowledge the statement and undertsand that while a models accuracy can be improved it can never be truly accurate.Therefore any \"model\" developer will acknowledge and quantify the uncertainty in the model. This can be done through any number of methods such as confidence intervals or Bayesian statistical methods and many more. This reduced overconfidence in a model and allows the model to be considered for the approximation it is."

    "**Code Verification**: Code verification is the process of ensuring that the code written (in this case to implement a model of a system) accuractely implements the intended algorithms and mathematical models. It is important to note the process only checks whether the code reflects the model correctly and does not check if the model represents the real world system well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Verification**: Solution verification is the process of ensuring that the output from the code is accurate to a sufficient degree. This involves chekcing the numerical solutions obtained against analytical solutions but can also involve a convergence study so that the solution does not change significantly with different mesh-sizes/discretisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Validation**: Model validation is used to confirm that the model represents the system accurately enough for its purpose. Once again this is done by comparing outputs from the model with experimental/analytical data or observations that have been made. This is different to solution verification because the code is not necessarily being checked here but rather the eqautions that model the system.\n",

    "This specific verification exercise is significant in showing the validity of the derived approximations because the exponential function used has a well know derivate. This can be thought of as its theoretical solution and is excellent for testing. By comparing the results with the analytical solution at $x=1$ the accuracy of the model is also able to be established.\n",

    "The verification exercise also showed the derived approximations and consistent with theoretical observations.One obsevarion, for example,is that a fourth-order method is expected to be far more accurate than that of a first-order method and this can clearly be seen in the exercise which reinforces the correctness of the approximations. Another theoretical observation is the error scaling. Different order methods are meant to scale a certain way, for example since the error in the first-order solution should be proportional to $\\Delta x$ the error in the fourth-order solution ${\\Delta x}^4$. There were assertion checks in place to ensure this and as the $\\Delta x$ decreases this scaling can be confirmed to occur. Similarly, for a third theoretical observation, it is expected that as $\\Delta x$ decreases the error should reduce until a certain point. This indicates a correct implmentation of the approximation.\n",

    "When dealing with finite difference approximations for derivatives, selecting the appropriate step size is important.For large values of $\\Delta x$ (tending to infinity) the error for all methods increase exponentially since the scale of the graph is a logarithmic one. This happens because the larger the step size, the less accurate the approximation becomes; important changes in the function's behavior over the interval are missed, and the truncation error grows as the higher-order terms in the Taylor series, which are ignored in the approximation, become substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For small values of $\\Delta x$ there is an area where the errors are at their minimum or low.After this point as $\\Delta x$ decreases further the error begins to increase again due to round-off errors. As $\\Delta x$ approaches $10^{-15}$ the error increases more significantly for higher order methods as the higher number of terms causes more loss of precision(floating point errors).This is especially evident in the plot for the fourth-order method.These behaviours are expected due to the reasons specified.\n",

    "The graph also reveals that the fourth-order central difference approximation not only achieves the lowest error in an optimal $\\Delta x$ range but also maintains this low error across the widest span of $\\Delta x$ values compared to lower-order methods.

Looking at the cubic spline interpolation it is clear that the error is very close to zero. This is a much more significant improvement than for the same interpolation for a uniformly distributed sub-intervals function. This is because Non-uniform sub-intervals allow the interpolation to adapt locally. Where the function changes rapidly, closer nodes mean that the cubic polynomial doesn't have to stretch as far to approximate the function, leading to higher accuracy."
